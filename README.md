## Features

* Multiple languages supported. Espanol, Français, Dansk, עברית version and Русский for European version.
* Auto saves your progress locally so remember to come back and update your progress!
* Tap background to randomly change the background color
* Mark where you want to go with "Want to be here" level (0 pts but different color)

## Disclaimer

Countries, states, and regions are artfully highly abstracted. Only major parts of countries are illustrated. For the European version, only sovereign countries with recognition from the overwhelming majority of other countries in the world are included.
